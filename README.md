Nebula Project Plugin
=====================
Provides healthy defaults for a Gradle project. Currently adds:

* Builds Javadoc, Sources and a Test jar
* Record information about the build and stores it in the .jar, via gradle-info-plugin
* Easy specification of people involved in a project via gradle-contacts-plugin
* Doesn't fail javadoc if there are none found
